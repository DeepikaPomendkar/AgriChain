            <h2><a name="climate"></a> Climatic Requirements</h2>
            <p>Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires warm and
            cool climate. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also
            light intensity affects pigmentation, fruit colour, fruit set. The plant
            is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions. It requires different
            climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower and fruit
            set, and fruit quality. Temperature below 10<sup>0</sup>C and above 38<sup>0</sup>C
            adversely affects plant tissues thereby slow down physiological
            activities. It thrives well in temperature 10<sup>0</sup>C to 30<sup>0</sup>C
            with optimum range of temperature is 21-24<sup>0</sup>C. The mean
            temperature below 16<sup>0</sup>C and above 27<sup>0</sup>C are not
            desirable. The plant doesn’t withstand frost, it requires low to
            medium rainfall, and does well under average monthly temperature of 21
            to 23<sup>0</sup>C. Avoid water stress and long dry period as it causes
            cracking of fruits. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to
            develop dark red coloured fruits.</p>

          <h2><a name="Soil Requirement"></a>Soil Requirement</h2>        
          <p>Tomatoes do very well on most mineral soils, but they
          prefer deep, well drained sandy loams. Upper layer of soil should be
          porous with little sand and good clay in the subsoil. Soil depth 15 to
          20cm proves to be good for healthy crop. Deep tillage can allow for
          adequate root penetration in heavy clay type soils, which allows for
          production in these soil types.<br /><br />Tomato is a moderately tolerant crop to a wide pH
          range. A pH of 5.5- 6.8 is preferred. Though tomato plants will do well
          in more acidic soils with adequate nutrient supply and availability.
          Tomato is moderately tolerant to acid an soil that is pH of 5.5. The
          soils with proper water holding capacity, aeration, free from salts are
          selected for cultivation.<br /><br />Soils extremely high in organic matter are not
          recommended due to the high moisture content of this media and nutrient
          deficiencies. But, as always, the addition of organic matter to mineral
          soils will increase yield.</p></div>

          <h2><a name="Choice"></a>Choice of seeds</h2>
          <p>After seed production, diseased, broken seeds are
          discarded. The seeds for sowing should be free from inert matter. Early
          germinating, bold, uniform in shape and size, seeds are selected for
          sowing. Hybrid seeds from F1 generation are advantageous for sowing as
          it gives early and high yield uniform fruity, resistant to adverse
          environmental conditions.</font></p>
          <strong>a) Seed and sowing</strong>
          <p>Tomato is generally cultivated by transplanting
          seedlings on ridges and furrows. At the time of transplanting seedlings
          are harder by exposing to open weather or by withholding irrigation. A
          seed rate of 400 to 500g/ha is required.</p>
          <p>Seeds are treated with Thiram @ 3g/kg of seed to
          protect from seed born diseases. Seed treatment with B. naphthoxyacetic
          acid (BNOA) at 25 and 50 ppm, gibberllic acid (GA3) at 5-20 ppm and
          chlorophenoxy acetic at 10 and 20 ppm was found to improve the growth
          and yield of tomato.</p>
          <p>Seeds are sown in June July for autumn winter crop
          and for spring summer crop seeds are sown in November. In the hills seed
          is sown in March April. The spacing recommended for the autumn winter
          crop is 75 x 60cm and for spring summer crop 75 x 45cm.</p>

                     <p>The ideal seedbed should be 60cm wide, 5-6cm long and
          20-25cm high. Clods and stubbles should be removed from the seedbed. Add
          sieved FYM and fine sand on the seedbed. Bring them to fine tilth.
          Drench the bed with Fytolon/Dithane M-45 @ 2-2.5 g/lit of water. Draw
          the lines 10 to 15cm apart throughout the length of the seedbed. Sow the
          seeds thinly spaced in lines, press gently, cover with fine sand and
          then cover the bed with straw. Irrigate with rose can. Irrigate the
          seedbed twice a day till the seeds germinate. Remove the straw after the

          <h2><a name="Fertilizers"></a>Fertilizers</h2>
          <p>As the fruit production and quality depends upon
          nutrient availability and fertilizer application so balance fertilizer
          are applied as per requirement. The nitrogen in adequate quantity
          increases fruit quality, fruit size, color and taste. It also helps in
          increasing desirable acidic flavor. Adequate amount of potassium is also
          required for growth, yield and quality. Mono Ammonium Phosphate (MAP)
          may be used as a starter fertilizer to supply adequate phosphorus during
          germination and seedling stages. Calcium availability is also very
          important to control soil pH and nutrient availability. Sandy soils will
          require a higher rate of fertilizer, and more frequent applications of
          these fertilizers due to increased leaching of essential nutrients. The
          seedlings are sprayed with starter solution of micronutrient. Before
          planting farm yard manure @ 50 ton per hectares should be incorporated.
          Normally tomato crop requires 120kg Nitrogen (N), 50kg Phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>),
          and 50kg Potash (K<sub>2</sub>O). Nitrogen should be given in split
          doses. Half nitrogen and full P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is given at the
          time of transplanting and remaining nitrogen is given after 30 days and
          60 days of transplanting.</p>
          <p>Soil and tissue analyses should be taken throughout
          the growing and production season to insure essential nutrients are in
          their proper amounts and ratios. Tissue analysis of a nutritionally
          sufficient plant will show the following nutrient status:</p>

        wide range of climatic conditions. However, it cannot stand too hot or too cold weather.
        It prefers moderate temperature in summer as well as in winter. Short days are very
        favourable for the formation of bulbs. It can be grown well at elevations of 1000 to 1300
        m above MSL. Garlic requires well drained loamy soils, rich in humus, with fairly good
        content of potash. The crop raised on sandy or loose soil does soils, the bulbs produced
        are deformed and during harvesting, many bulbs are broken and bruised and so they do not

        Onion are a cold-season crop, easy to grow because of their hardiness. We plant onions early in the spring
        and harvest in the fall after their tops begin to turn yellow and fall over.</p>
      <h3 class="pane-title">Planting</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Plant onions as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring, usually late March or April. Make sure temperature
                doesn’t go below 20 degrees&nbsp;F.</li>
              <li>Select a location with full Sun where your onions won’t be shaded by other&nbsp;plants.</li>
              <li>Soil needs to be well-drained, loose, and rich in nitrogen; compact soil affects bulb&nbsp;development.</li>
              <li>Till in aged manure or fertilizer the fall before planting. Onion plants&nbsp;are heavy feeders and need constant
                nourishment to produce big&nbsp;bulbs.</li>
              <li>At planting time, you can mix in some nitrogen fertilizer, too, and side dress every few weeks until the bulbing
                process&nbsp;begins.
              </li>
              <li>Seeding? Onion seeds are short-lived. If planting seeds indoors, start with fresh seeds each year. Start seeds
                indoors about 6 weeks before&nbsp;transplanting.</li>
              <li>For sets or transplants, plant the smaller sets 1 inch deep, with 4 to 5 inches between each plant and in rows
                12 to 18 inches&nbsp;apart.</li>
              <li>Think of onions as a leaf crop, not a root crop. When planting onion sets, don’t bury them more than one inch
                under the soil; if more than the bottom third of the bulb is underground, bulb growth can be&nbsp;restricted.</li>
              <li>Practice crop rotation with&nbsp;onions.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Fertilize every few weeks with nitrogen to get big bulbs. Cease fertilizing when the onions push the soil away
                and the bulbing process has started. Do not put the soil back around the onions; the bulb needs to emerge
                above the&nbsp;soil.</li>
              <li>Generally, onion plants&nbsp;do not need consistent watering if mulch is used. About one inch of water per
                week (including rain water) is sufficient. If you want sweeter onions, water&nbsp;more.</li>
              <li>Onions will look healthy even if they are bone dry, be sure to water during drought&nbsp;conditions.</li>
              <li>Make sure soil is well-drained. Mulch will help retain moisture and stifle&nbsp;weeds.</li>

                and knock the onion tops against it; if thrips are present, you will spot their tan-colored bodies on the
                paper. A couple of treatments with insecticidal soap kills them. Follow the package directions. Spray the
                plants twice, three days apart, and the thrips should&nbsp;disappear.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Onion Maggots</strong>: Cover your emerging onion crop with a fine mesh netting. Seal it by mounding soil
                around the edges. The onion maggot likes to lay its eggs at the base of plants, so the netting should prevent
                that. You should also keep mulch away because the insects like decaying organic matter, and make sure you
                completely harvest your onions as the season progresses. Onion maggots are usually a problem in very rainy
                periods, so these precautions may be unnecessary if you have a dry&nbsp;season.</li>

              <p>There are three varieties of peas that will&nbsp;suit your garden and cooking&nbsp;needs:&nbsp;</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <em>Pisum savitum</em>, which includes both types of garden peas:&nbsp;
                  <strong>sweet peas</strong> (inedible pods) and
                  <strong>snow peas</strong> (edible flat pods with small peas&nbsp;inside).</li>
                <li>
                  <em>Pisum macrocarpon</em>,
                  <strong>snap peas</strong> (edible pods with full-size&nbsp;peas).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Pea plants are easy to grow, but have a very limited growing season.&nbsp;Furthermore, peas&nbsp;do not stay

          <li>Get them in the ground while the soil is still cool, but do not have them sit too long in wet soil. It’s a delicate

          <li>A blanket of snow won’t hurt emerging pea plants, but several days with temperatures in the teens could. Be prepared

          <li>Be sure, too, that you don’t fertilize the soil too much. Peas are especially sensitive to too much nitrogen, but

          <li>Water sparsely unless the plants are wilting. Do not let plants dry out, or no pods will be&nbsp;produced.</li>

    <h4>1.3 Plant description</h4>

    <div>Rice plant is an annual warm-season grass (monocot plant) with round culms, flat leaves and terminal panicles.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Rice is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a
      ratoon crop up to 20 years. The rice plant can grow to 1–1.8 m tall, occasionally more, depending on the variety and
      soil fertility. The grass has long, slender leaves 50–100&nbsp;cm long and 2–2.5&nbsp;cm broad. The small wind-pollinated
      flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50&nbsp;cm long. The edible seed is a grain
      (caryopsis) 5–12&nbsp;mm long and 2–3&nbsp;mm thick.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <strong>The grain</strong>
      <br>The single seed is fused with the wall, which is the pericarp of the ripened ovary forming the grain. Each rice panicle
      (which is a determinate inflorescence on the terminal shoot), when ripened, contains on average 80-120 grains, depending
      on varietal characteristics, environmental conditions and the level of crop management. The floral organs are modified
      shoots consisting of a panicle, on which are arranged a number of spikelets. Each spikelet bears a floret which, when
      fertilized, develops into a grain.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <strong>Rice grain structure</strong>
      <br>A kernel of rice consists of a hull and a bran coat, both of which are removed on polishing "white" rice. In general,
      each rice kernel is composed of the following layers:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice shell, hull or husk: encloses the bran coat, the embryo and the endosperm.</li>
      <li>Bran Coat (layer): a very thin layer of differentiated tissues. The layer contains fiber, vitamin B, protein and fat.
        The most nutritious part of rice resides in this layer.</li>
      <li>Embryo: The innermost part of a rice grain consists mainly of starch called amylase and amylo pectin. The mixture of
        these two starches determines the cooking texture of rice. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A crop producing on average 300 panicles per m2 and 100 spikelets per panicle, with an average spikelet sterility of
      15 % at maturity and a 1000-grain weight of 20 g will have an expected yield of 5.1 t/ha.</p>
  <div>
    <h4>1.5 Soil</h4>

    <div>
      <div>
        <span>Soil type: A rice paddy needs to hold water well. Ideally, soil needs to include about 50% clay content. Also, soil
          underlain with an impervious hardpan or clay-pan helps to hold water.</span>

      <h4>1.6 Irrigation</h4>

      <div>
        <div>
          <span>Rice can grow in either a wet (paddy) or a dry (field) setting. (</span>Rice fields are also called paddy fields
          or rice paddies).</div>
        <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <span>About 75% of the global rice production comes from irrigated rice systems because most rice varieties express their
            full yield potential when water supply is adequate. </span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <span>In cooler areas, during late spring, water serves also as a heat-holding medium and creates a much milder environment
            for rice growing.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <span>A pond could hold irrigation water to use in the summer, when demand for water is the greatest.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <span>The bulk of the rice in Asia is grown during the wet season starting in June-July, and dependence on rainfall is
            the most limiting production constraint for rain-fed culture. Rice areas in South and Southeast Asia may, in
            general, be classified into irrigated, rain-fed upland, rain-fed shallow water lowland and rain-fed deep water
            lowland areas.</span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
          <span>The productivity of well-managed, irrigated rice is highest, being in the range of 5-8 t/ha during the wet season
            and 7-10 t/ha during the dry season if very well managed, but the average is often only in the range of 3-5 t/ha.
            The productivity of rain-fed upland and deep water lowland rice, however, continues to be low and is static around
            1.0 t/ha.</span>

      <h4>1.7 Varieties</h4>

      <div>
        <span>There are more than 40,000 varieties of cultivated rice (
          <em>Oryza sativa L.</em>), but the exact figure is uncertain. Over 90,000 samples of cultivated and wild rice species
          are stored at the International Rice Gene Bank and these are used by researchers all over the world.</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        <span>There are four main types of rice: Indica, Japonica, aromatic, and glutinous. Rice seeds vary in shape, size, width,
          length, color and aroma. There are many different varieties of rice: drought-resistant, pest-resistant, flood-resistant,
          saline-resistant, tall, short, aromatic, sticky, with red, violet, brown, or black; long and slender; or short
          and round grains.</span>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span></span>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>Extensive studies of the varieties have demonstrated that they were independently derived from the wild rice species
        <em>Oryza rufipogon</em>. The domesticated varieties show much less variation (polymorphism) than the wild species.</div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>
        <span>Rice cultivars (
          <em>Oryza sativa L</em>.) are divisible into the Indica and Japonica types, or subspecies
          <em>indica</em> and
          <em>japonica</em>, which differ in various morphophysiological traits. </span>These two main varieties of domesticated
        rice (
        <em>Oryza sativa</em>), one variety,
        <em>O. sativa indica</em> can be found in India and Southeast Asia while the other,
        <em>O. sativa japonica</em>, is mostly cultivated in Southern China. </div>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
      <div>In general, the rice family can be broken down into three main categories:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Long Grain</strong>: Approx. 6-8 mm long, about 3-4 times longer than thick. The endosperm is hard&nbsp;and vitreous.
          The best long grain varieties come from Thailand, Southern US, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Vietnam.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medium Grain</strong>: Approx. 5-6 mm long, but thicker than long grain rice. The endosperm is&nbsp;soft and chalky.
          It releases about 15% starch into water during cooking. Medium grain rice is mainly grown in China, Egypt and Italy.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short Grain </strong>or
          <strong>Round Grain</strong>: Approx. 4-5 mm long, only 1.5-2 times longer than thick. The endosperm is soft and chalky.
          This&nbsp;variety is grown in subtropical areas like California, Egypt, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain and&nbsp;Portugal.</li>

    <h2>Sugarcane &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Revenue/Hectare: Rs{{price}}</h2>
    <p>Sugarcane is a tall perennial grass of the genus Saccharum, native to Southeast Asia and parts of the South Pacific.
      It can grow in warm temperate or tropical climates. The internodes of the plant stalk are rich in the sugar sucrose,
      and the plants can grow to a height of two to six meters in height.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Every cultivar of commercially-grown sugarcane is a complex hybrid between several species and subspecies, all of which
      can potentially cross.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>PLANTING CONDITIONS</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Climate</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Though sugarcane can be cultivated in temperate zones, productivity is much higher in tropical climates. A long, sunny,
      and hot (32 °C to 38 °C, 90 °F to 100 °F) growing season with moderate to high levels of rainfall (1100 and 1500 mm
      total), combined with a dry and cooler (12 ˚C to 14 ˚C, 54 °F to 57 °F) harvest season is ideal.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Soil</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sugarcane can grow in various types of soils - sandy, loamy, and clay soils, as well as both acidic and alkaline soils
      (within the pH range of 5 to 8.5). A well-drained loam with a pH of roughly 6.5 is absolutely ideal, but mechanical
      factors like soil compaction are much more consequential to crop success than soil composition and pH.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>GROWTH AND HARVEST</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Planting&nbsp;</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sugarcane is vegetatively or clonally propagated, in order to ensure consistent cultivar characteristics. Planting is
      usually the most expensive procedure in the growing season.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Stalk sections, called “billets,” “setts,” or “seed pieces”—containing one or more buds—are usually planted in late summer,
      rooting and developing into a stand over winter.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>During this time, the rooting plants are very vulnerable to rot and predation, and are thus often sprayed with insecticide
      and fungicide before being placed in the seedbed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Growing&nbsp;</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sugarcane can take between 9-24 months to harvest, depending on the climate. There is one harvest of the primary crop,
      and then 3-4 harvests of the “ratoon”, or regrowth.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In areas with less than 1500 millimeters meters of annual rainfall, the crop requires drip irrigation.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ripening&nbsp;</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>Ripening lasts for about three months, in which time the stalk dries out and accelerate the synthesis and storage of
      sugar. Simple sugars like fructose are converted into sucrose during ripening.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Harvest&nbsp;</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>A cane harvester is used to cut down the full stalks, and cut them into smaller sections (around 30 cm). The harvester
      is trailed by a cane haulout, which collects the billets.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The amount of sugar accumulated in the dry weight at harvest is highly variable, and depends on the climate conditions
      during the various phases of the plant’s growth.</p>
